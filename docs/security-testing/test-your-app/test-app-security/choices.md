# Automatically test APIs for security vulnerabilities

## [I want effortless and instant testing](./zero-conf/zero-conf.md)
![](../../../assets/zero-conf-test-plan.svg)

    Does not require data provisioning or parameter configuration
   
    Runs instantly 

    Reduced security test coverage

    Reduced efficacy of test results

## [I want comprehensive test coverage and better efficacy](./data-driven/data-driven.md)
![](../../../assets/data-driven-test-plan.svg)


    Best security test coverage

    Best efficacy of test results

    Requires data/parameter configuration for API endpoints

    May require associating API endpoints with RBAC info via a metadata.yml file
