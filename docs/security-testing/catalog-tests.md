# Running Tests from Catalog

Levo's application provides you with the feature to run a variety of tests on your endpoints using our Test Runs feature.

It runs on our Platform and can be configured to run various tests in just a few minutes.

Just head over to the `Applications` tab and choose an Application you want to run tests on.

Click on `Run Tests` on the top right side and then choose `Run on Cloud`.

Select Runnable Endpoints from the screen that comes up.

>Note: You can configure a non-runnable endpoint by entering a sample value for mandatory query parameters.

Click on Next and select the categories of test you want to run from and choose from a wide variety of Tests like BOLA, SQLI, CORS, Fuzzing, etc.

Enter a Target URL to run tests against, e.g. `http://crapi.levo.ai` and click on `Run Tests` to start the tests' execution.
