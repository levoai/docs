# Sample Applications FAQs

## crAPI

#### Why are several test cases in the onboarding test plan for crAPI disabled?
The objective of onboarding is to let new users experience Levo's security testing capabilities in a quick and stress free manner. To keep the test plan execution time for onboarding under 5 minutes, we disable some tests.

We ensure that there is at least one test case enabled, for each vulnerability type that we test for.
