# Welcome to Levo!

Levo comprises of two components, a Sensor which runs alongside your application workloads, and a Satellite.
The Sensor captures live traffic from your environment and sends it to the Satellite for processing.

Levo can host the Satellite for you (reach out to [`support@levo.ai`](mailto:support@levo.ai)), or you can host it yourself.
