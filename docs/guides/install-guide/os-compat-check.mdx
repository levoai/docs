# Compatibility Check
The Sensor is currently supported on Linux Hosts & Kubernetes running *directly* on Linux.

Levo provides a simple bash script that *checks* your Linux host for compatibility.

Execute the following on the Linux host you want instrument with the Sensor:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';

export function CurlScript() {
  return (
    <BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {() => (
        <pre>
          <code>
              curl -s {window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + '/artifacts/sensor/check-compatibility.sh'} | bash
          </code>
        </pre>
      )}
    </BrowserOnly>
  );
}

export function DownloadLink() {
  return (
    <BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {() => (
        <a href={window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + '/artifacts/sensor/check-compatibility.sh'}> here</a>
      )}
    </BrowserOnly>
  );
}

<CurlScript/>

If you want to **audit** the script prior to running, you can download it <DownloadLink/>.

## Host is compatible!

If your host is compatible with the Sensor (as reported by the script), you can proceed with the installation.

## Host is *NOT* compatible

**Levo can provide a custom build of the Sensor that is compatible with your system.**

If the host is not compatible, it is very likely due missing [BTF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html) info. BTF provides the Sensor with essential type information required to instrument the host. Most modern Linux distributions come prepackaged with BTF.

Please contact `support@levo.ai` with the diagnostic information provided by the script. We will provide a compatible Sensor promptly.
