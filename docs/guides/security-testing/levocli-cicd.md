# Levo CLI in CI/CD

![Embed Levo in CI/CD Quality Gates](../../assets/levo-quality-gates.svg)

You can embed Levoâ€™s contract & security tests in various stages of your software delivery pipeline via CI/CD [Quality Gates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/gates?view=azure-devops).

While Levo can be embedded in any CI/CD product (via the CLI), below are first class integrations.

- [GitHub Actions](/security-testing/github-action)
- [Jenkins](/security-testing/jenkins-plugin)

## Others

Need support for a CI/CD vendor that is not listed above?

Levo's autogenerated tests can be embedded in any CI/CD product by simply wrapping the Levo CLI in a shell script that is invoked by your CI/CD vendor's job hooks.

Contact `support@levo.ai` for more information.
