# BIG-IP LTM
## iRule-based Instrumentation

        { label: 'Logs via HTTP', value: 'http', },

### Pre-requisites
- Permissions to add iRule to the Virtual Servers.
- Permissions to create a Pool and add members to the Pool

### Installation
To instrument your APIs from the LTM Virtual Servers, you need to:
1. Install the satellite on a node, and add the node to pool.
2. Download and configure the iRule script
3. Add the iRule to the VirtualServers you want to instrument 

#### Install the satellite and create pool

- Create a Node and [install satellite][install-satellite].
- Note the IP for the satellite VM
- Create a Pool in F5 BIG-IP setup. Set the pool name to `levo-satellite-pool`
- Add a member to pool, and use the satellite IP and port `54526`


#### Download and configure iRule Script

- Download the [iRule script](../../static/artifacts/scripts/levo-irule-tcp.tcl)
- Ensure the `static::hsl_pool` variable is same as the satellite pool name you created above.

#### Add the iRule to the VirtualServers you want to instrument

- In the BIG-IP Dashboard, go to, `Local Traffic > iRules > iRule List`
- Click on `Create` and paste the downloaded iRule inside the Definition. Give the script a name and click on `Finished`
- Next, go to,  `Local Traffic > Virtual Servers > Virtual Server List` 
- Click on the virtual server which you want to instrument.
- Under the `Resources` section, locate iRules. Click on Manage
- Move the Levo's iRule script to `Enabled` section. Click on `Finished`.

The iRule script will start instrumenting and send the traces to Levo's Collector.

### Pre-requisites
- You have sufficient permissions to add iRule to the Virtual Servers.
- The Satellite has been successfully set up and is reachable from the BIG-IP LTM.

### Installation
To instrument your APIs from the LTM Virtual Servers, you need to:
1. Download and configure the iRule script
2. Add the iRule to the VirtualServers you want to instrument

#### Download and configure iRule Script

- Download the [iRule script](../../static/artifacts/scripts/levo-irule.tcl)

- You need to expose the satellite's levoai-haproxy service so that virtual server should be able to reach satellite. 
Locate `collector_host_ip` and `collector_host_port` inside the script, and set them to appropriate values.
You may also need to setup outbound rules on virtual server to allow communication to satellite host.

#### Add the iRule to the VirtualServers you want to instrument

- In the BIG-IP Dashboard, go to, `Local Traffic > iRules > iRule List`
- Click on `Create` and paste the downloaded iRule inside the Definition. Give the script a name and click on `Finished`
- Next, go to,  `Local Traffic > Virtual Servers > Virtual Server List` 
- Click on the virtual server which you want to instrument.
- Under the `Resources` section, locate iRules. Click on Manage
- Move the Levo's iRule script to `Enabled` section. Click on `Finished`.

The iRule script will start instrumenting and send the traces to Levo's Collector.
