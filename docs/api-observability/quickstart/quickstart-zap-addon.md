# Quickstart with OWASP ZAP

The Levo.ai add-on for ZAP allows building OpenAPI specs with the traffic sent or proxied via ZAP.

This guide assumes that you have [signed up for a Levo account](https://app.levo.ai/signup) and have [installed a recent version of ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) (> 2.12.0).

Here are the steps you need to follow to start building OpenAPI specs with Levo and ZAP:
1. The OpenAPI spec is built by sending anonymized API traces to Levo. You may run the *Satellite* (a set of services which receives and processes the traces) locally using docker or minikube, on AWS with an AMI provided by Levo, or use a temporary 40-minute instance spun-up by Levo using Google Cloud Run.
   1. If you want to run the satellite yourself, follow the instructions on [this page](/api-observability/install-guide/install-satellite) as per your prefered mode of installation.
    Note that the collector does not need to be enabled.
    ZAP should be able to reach the satellite at port `9999`.
    If the satellite is running inside a container, you may need to forward a port from the host to port `9999` inside the container.
   2. The easier option is to use a temporary satellite instance provided by Levo.
    Go to Organizations &rarr; Satellite in the Levo dashboard, generate and enter an authorization key, and start the satellite. Copy the provided Cloud Run URL.

2. Launch ZAP and install the Levo.ai add-on from the [ZAP Marketplace](https://www.zaproxy.org/addons/). You may need to restart ZAP after the add-on is installed.
3. If the add-on is successfully installed, you should see a new button in the main toolbar.

   Clicking on it will toggle sending traffic to Levo's satellite.
4. Navigate to Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; Levo.ai in ZAP and enter the URL pointing to the satellite (e.g. `http://localhost:9999`).

5. Ensure that the Levo button is enabled in the toolbar, and you are good to go! Start browsing your website using ZAP and you should start seeing auto-discovered applications in your Levo dashboard in a few minutes.
